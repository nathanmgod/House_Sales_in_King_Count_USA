# House Sales in King Count USA
This is my capstone project for the course Data Analysis with Python, which is part of the IBM Data Science Certification. In this assignment, I did the job of a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I was tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I analyzed and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
